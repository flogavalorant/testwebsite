                        Unbeatable Broker! Selva helped us to navigate the challenging process of buying our first home from start to finish. He communicated clearly each step of the way and went above and beyond - even on the weekends and while he was on holiday - to make sure we were at ease and informed. Selva has a kind and understanding approach, he made it his mission to get our mortgage over the line as quickly as possible and helped us to achieve the best possible outcome. Couldn’t recommend a better broker - if you want someone who is dedicated, professional and solutions focused Selva is your man. Thank you Selva - you’re a legend!

                        Far exceeded my expectations & has gone above and
                        beyond! Selva is absolutely outstanding with the
                        service he provides, his knowledge and his passion
                        for helping people. I am so grateful that Selva
                        continued to follow up with my husband and I decided
                        to go with Selva after many other brokers would give
                        us our scenario and leave it at that. Selva presented
                        us with options and different scenarios of what we
                        could do. His professionalism is second to none and
                        as a person is caring, helpful and kind. Selva
                        communicates efficiently and effectively and I have
                        felt involved and up to date with everything
                        happening. I highly highly recommend Selva!
